# Security Policy
Our team has decided to keep the Backend separate from Frontend 

- Isolation of Sensitive Information: Separating the backend and frontend helps in isolating sensitive information and logic, such as database credentials, authentication mechanisms, and business logic. This reduces the risk of exposing critical data to potential attackers through the frontend.
